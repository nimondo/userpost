MVVM-User
======

This is a simple sample Android app written in **Kotlin**, Personally I feel, Kodein is suitable for smaller projects

**Setup**
	
- MVVM pattern using Architecture Components
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit), [RxJava 2, RxAndroid 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) for API calls

This app can be used as a base template for yor Android Apps and can be used as a template for your apps.
